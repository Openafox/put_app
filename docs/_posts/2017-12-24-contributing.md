# Contributing Code

I would love your help, either as ideas, documentation, or code.

This project is still being used but is not actively being worked on [gmrfilm](https://github.com/openafox/put_app)
Trying to follow Python's PEP-8 closely and write really good doc strings.

PR's are great and if you wanted to go at it I am willing to make you a manager.

Ideas to work on and other notes can be found in the [work log]({{site.baseurl}}/info/log).

Thank you!

Austin
